# Deep learning model for predicting flower species

In 1936, Ronald Fisher, a British statistician and biologist, created the Iris flower data set [6], which is a multivariate data set. The data set includes measurements of the length and width of sepals and petals in centimeters for three species of flowers: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica, and Iris Versicolor. Each species has 50 records, making a total of 150 records in the data set.

The data set has four feature variables about the flower namely

    Sepal length
    Sepal width
    Petal length
    Petal width

The target class is the flower species.
There are three classes namely

    Setosa
    Versicolor
    Virginica

The goal of this project is to build an ANN model to predict the flower species.
